# Basic Todo App (React Native)

A small React Native todo app for adding, completing, and deleting tasks â€” kept intentionally minimal for learning and quick daily use.

### Features

- Add, complete, and delete todos with a clean, minimal UI.
- Runs with Expo or React Native CLI based on preference and setup.
- Easy to extend if more features are needed later (e.g., persistence).

### Requirements

- Node.js LTS and npm installed locally.
- Expo tooling (npx expo)
- Android Studio and/or Xcode if using device simulators or native CLI.

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/im-apratap/Todo-MobileApp.git
cd todo-app
npm install
```

### Run (Expo)

```bash
npx expo start
# press "a" for Android, "i" for iOS simulator, or scan the QR in Expo Go
```


### Folder Notes

- Standard RN layout with an app entry and a couple of simple components/screens for todos.[5][1]
- Keep code small and readable; no complex state or architecture here by design.[1][2]
